# BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Simulator

*"Where quantum physics meets unbreakable encryption"*  

**A hands-on journey through quantum cryptography** - Experience the revolutionary BB84 protocol that uses the strange laws of quantum mechanics to create perfectly secure communication.

## Why This Matters

In a world of increasing cyber threats, quantum cryptography offers:
- **Provable security** backed by physics laws
- **Eavesdropper detection** - know immediately if someone's listening
- **Future-proof** protection against quantum computers

This simulator makes these complex concepts **visually intuitive** and interactive.

## How to Use

1. **Alice prepares** qubits in random states (|0‚ü©, |1‚ü©, |+‚ü©, |-‚ü©)
2. **Bob measures** them in random bases
3. **Compare bases** to distill a secret key
4. **Toggle Eve** to see how quantum mechanics exposes eavesdroppers

## Simulation Output Example

Output- 
üîÅ Attempt 3
Sifted Key Length: 9
QBER: 22.22%
Eve Detected: True
Sifted Key (Alice): [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
Sifted Key (Bob):   [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

‚úÖ Secure key established after 3 attempts!

## The Science Behind It
The BB84 protocol leverages two quantum principles:

- Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Measuring quantum states disturbs them
- No-Cloning Theorem: Quantum states cannot be perfectly copied

When Eve intercepts:

- She guesses wrong basis 75% of the time
- Introduces ~25% error rate (detectable by Alice & Bob)
- Perfect security when QBER < 11%

## Dependencies
Python 3.8+
Qiskit
Matplotlib
NumPy

## Roadmap
- Add quantum channel noise simulation
- Implement error correction
- Add multi-qubit entanglement visualization
